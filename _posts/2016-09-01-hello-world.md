### Welcome!  
The practitioners at Copyleft.io are professionals in the field of technology. We have varying
backgrounds and experience ranging from software development and big data analytics to cloud
services and infrastructure engineering.

<br>
Our team initially met and worked together over the course of several years for
an international startup based in Nashville, Chicago, and London. During our time
working together we enjoyed the challenge and freedom of using open source technology
to deliver and support a big data analytics and targeting platform for financial
institutions in the payment card and advertising industry.

<br>
As we have moved about to explore new opportunities we've used Copyleft.io
as a way to stay connected while working in the field.  H
ere you will also find our thoughts, ideas, rants, and inner daemons.

<br>
Cheers!
<br>-Brian
