# Hello World!

### Welcome!  
The hobbyists at Copyleft.io are practitioners in the field of technology. We have varying
backgrounds and experience ranging from software development, big data analytics, to
infrastructure engineering.

<br>
Our team initially met and worked together over the
course of several years for an international startup based in Nashville, Chicago,
and London. During our time working together we enjoyed the challenge and freedom of
using open source technology to deliver and support a big data analytics and targeting platform
for financial institutions in the payment card and advertising industry.

<br>
As we have moved about to explore new opportunities we've used Copyleft.io
as a way to stay connected while working in the field.  Here you will find our thoughts,
ideas, rants, and inner daemons.

<br>
Cheers!
<br>-Brian
