Let's start with the WHY behind Copyleft.io and explain our thoughts about why we launched.  

We believe that we all possess a deeply human desire to be a part of something that is bigger than ourselves and to do better by our community.  To do great work you must love what you do.

The technology landscape is quickly changing. Now more than ever engineering and development using open source solutions is front and center for delivering business value.  

Organizations and teams of any size from startups to large enterprises can benefit greatly. We want to make practitioner level consulting for open source technology more accessible for businesses and organizations in our community.  

We are not your typical company or consulting group. Our passion is for serving the communities where we live, learn, work and play.  We believe that we can best achieve that goal by sharing what we do.  
(1) We open source everything... from documentation to code.  
(2) We carefully select our projects and our clients.
(3) As true craftsmen, we only deliver solutions that we can be proud of.
