                    <p>We are a unique blend of talented engineers who share a passion for designing, building, and shipping open source
                      solutions.  We have hands-on experience delivering highly automated, scalable, flexible, and cost
                      effective cloud platforms using open source technology. </p>
                    <p>Our team of hobbyists initially met and worked together over the course of several years for an international startup based in Nashville.
                      As we have moved about to take on new opportunities, we launched Copyleft.io as a way to stay connected and to
                    provide a mechanism for sharing our findings, rantings, projects, and inner daemons.</p>
                    <p>Based in Nashville Tennessee we are focused on serving the communities where we live, learn, work and play.</p>
