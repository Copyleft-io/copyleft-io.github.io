                    <p>We are a caffeinated and hoppy blend of developers and engineers who share a
                      passion for technology and open source.  Like the local coffee house or corner brewpub
                      this is simply a place where we gather to ask questions, share observations, occasionaly
                      rant and exercise our inner daemons.</p>
                      <p>Our team of hobbyists initially met and worked together
                        over the course of several years for an international startup. As we
                        have moved about to explore new opportunities we've used Copyleft.io
                        as a way to stay connected while working in the field. </p>
